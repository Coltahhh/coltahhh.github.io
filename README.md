Harrison's Linktree

This project was inspired by my uncle who created a similar website from scratch. My goal is for this to be any easy tool that allows anyone to have access to all of my socails/contact information.

With no coding experience I took to the web and found a course called Mimo. Mimo is like Duolingo, but for programming and web development. This course provided me with all the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This steered me in the right direction
while creating my website and kept me movtivated to not only learn more, but to persue other projects in the near future. During the development of this small site, I ran into errors, roadblocks, and frustration. However, all of that doesn't amount to much
due to how much I enjoyed this project.

I intend to use this website as material during my job search. Having content like this to show off to employers is a step in the right direction. I find myself passionate in persuing this as a career and I'm proud to get started!
